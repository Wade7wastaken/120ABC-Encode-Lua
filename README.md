# 120ABC-Encode-Lua

A lua script made for [mupen64-rr](https://github.com/mkdasher/mupen64-rr-lua-).
This script was made for the SM64 120ABC (collecting every star in as few A presses as possible) project.
It includes an input display, variable display, author display.
I plan to add a STROOP style map and other visualizations.
